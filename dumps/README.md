# Dumps

Each subdirectory here contains JSON dumps for different game versions as generated by injecting [DumpStructs](/src/DumpStructs/) into the game process. The following games are included:
- **rdr3**: Red Dead Redemption 2
- **gta5**: Grand Theft Auto V

### Registry

[`registry.json`](./registry.json) keeps track of the existing dumps. Used by [Pages](/src/Pages/). Must be manually updated when adding a new dump, otherwise Pages will not include it.

### Dictionary

[`dictionary.txt`](./dictionary.txt) contains the list of strings used to resolve hashes in the dumps.

To contribute new strings, add them anywhere in the file and before opening a PR, execute either [`sort_dictionary.ps1`](./sort_dictionary.ps1) or [`sort_dictionary.sh`](./sort_dictionary.sh) from this directory. This will sort the whole dictionary and remove any duplicate strings.
